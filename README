# Gallery 4 Docker Compose Stack

## Getting Started

Use `docker compose up -d` command to starts the containers.

## Running on Portainer

Running on Portainer needs the ability to mount volumes to project file, as we are injecting the `Caddyfile` configuration file to caddy. 
Unfortunately the *Enable relative path volumes* is only available on the business edition version of Portainer.

This flag needs to be set before deploying the stack, as it can't be set or reset afterward.

Make sure to set the environment variables before running the stack.
